# Obfuscated C fun:My Pretty Calendar

For some strange reason, the lovely nursery rhyme that I wrote to celebrate **my pretty calendar** outputs some **notorious planetary greetings**.
Very mysterious!
 
-> In other words: a bit of fun with simple obfuscation in C.

# How to compile it
To compile it, just make sure that both the .c and .h files are in the same directory.

You can compile it easily in GCC with something like
```
$gcc -std=c99 -o pretty_calendar my_pretty_calendar.c
```
and then run with
```
$./pretty_calendar
```
Enjoy! :-)
